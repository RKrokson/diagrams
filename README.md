# diagrams - templates for starting a conversation
Diagrams usually improve the quality of a conversation. I love the examples Nehali, and other contributors, are creating in Draw.io in her GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/nehalineogi/azure-networking). Draw.io is a little heavy for my day to day use case. The Draw.io layers are great for stepping through a scenario but I'm often mapping out a new architecture or troubleshooting.

I decided to build my own templates based on my conversations with customers. I'm using [Excalidraw.com](Excalidraw.com) because it's easy to use and share with others. You can launch Excalidraw as a progress web app (from Chrome or Edge) and pin it to your taskbar. There is also a VS Code plugin so you can easily edit multiple diagrams at the same time. 

A few people encouraged me to share my templates so I'll upload them here as I clean them up.
